Mar High, our director of product design, kicks off the series by interviewing
Christina Roitzheim, the co-founder of not less but better. Christina shares how
her team, which helps users learn healthy smartphone habits, goes from idea to
release.

Christina shares a valuable key learning with us:

"Pressure doesn't solve problems." Therefore, Christina offers her help and
tries to not be the person to create pressure on her team.

What a powerful take away! 💥

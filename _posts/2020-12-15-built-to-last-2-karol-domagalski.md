In the simplabs' Built to Last interview series, we talk to founders and company
leaders about personal experiences, struggles, and learnings in their journey of
successfully shaping product development processes.

Upfit is 100% bootstrapped and Karol is proud of that. One of his key takeaways
is: "Invest in your own company, in your own people, and help them grow.
Sparring and mentorship inside the company is super important."

We couldn't agree more! 💯 Thanks for sharing your learnings, Karol.

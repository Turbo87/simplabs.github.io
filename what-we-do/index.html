  <h2>Custom Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    We focus on a set of framework and languages that we realize most of our projects with.
  </p>
  <h2>Consulting</h2>
  <p>
    We are <strong>enthusiastic about agile practices</strong> and a flexible development process. While we don't think planning is evil per se <strong>we don't overplan and communicate with our customers a lot</strong>. We usually recommend having a kick-off meeting to get the project going and from that on refine things as needed.

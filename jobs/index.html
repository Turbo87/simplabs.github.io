<h2>Intern or Working Student in Munich</h2>
<p>
  We are <strong>looking for a student who is interested in the web as a platform, is passionate about modern technologies and well crafted code and able to learn and apply new things quickly</strong>. Besides working on our client and open source projects which are built with the latest web technologies and frameworks like ES2015 (ES6), Ember.js and Elixir, they will also work on internal projects on their own authority.
</p>
<p>
  We offer <strong>competitive compensation, the possibility to attend and speak at international conferences</strong> (like Ember Conf 2016 in Portland, USA which we are sponsoring), an experienced international team that maintains and contributes to some of the most popular Ember.js libraries and a nice office in Munich. We will <strong>provide you with a MacBook Pro and a Cinema Display</strong> to make sure you have a nice working setup.

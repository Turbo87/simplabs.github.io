  <h2>Engineering Agency based in Munich, Germany</h2>
  <p>
    simplabs is an <strong>Engineering and Consulting Agency based in Munich, Germany</strong>. It was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoow">Marco Otte-Witte</a> after having worked freelance for numerous startups for over 10 years. If we cannot provide something ourselves, we have a <strong>network of trusted freelance engineers and designers</strong> that we work with.

  <h2>simplabs <i class="love"></i> Open Source</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>simplabs loves Open Source</strong> and we don't only <a href="/what-we-use">use it to realize our customer's projects</a> but also actively contribute and <a href="https://github.com/simplabs">maintain a number of projects ourselves</a>. You might e.g. have stumbled upon the <strong>Ember.js authentication library <a href="https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth">Ember Simple Auth</a></strong>. You can also find the <a href="https://github.com/simplabs/simplabs.github.io">source for this website on github</a>.
